# Scrape-website
In this repository, i will pull in some of my experiments in collecting data in bulk by scraping. These codes just be used for research and education.

## Get book dataset from www.bukabuku.com by scrape:
1. Define the book category (Anak-Anak, Arsitektur & Design Interior, or etc). I choose "Orang Tua & Keluarga, Psikologi).

2. So, the url link will change to this. "59" is unique number of book category on that website.

3. Then, i want to get title, author, real price, price after discount, description, and link of the books.

   Book description can be found inside the link of the book (just click the title, and boom!)
